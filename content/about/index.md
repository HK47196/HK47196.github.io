# About me

## Introduction
Hello! I'm Roger. I have years of programming experience, spanning from system-level C++ development to contemporary web technologies.

## My Journey
My adventure began with C++, a language that taught me the importance of resource and memory management. Over the years, I've embraced various technologies, constantly expanding my toolkit.

## Embracing Web Development
Recently, I've channeled my passion for development into the web domain, exploring the potential of TypeScript and React to create responsive and user-centric applications.

## Game Development
In my spare time I enjoy tinkering around with game development. Recently, I've
picked up Godot and am having a lot of fun prototyping projects in it.

## Connect with Me
I welcome professional connections, collaboration proposals, and discussions on technology and software development. For inquiries or to discuss potential projects, please contact me at rogerswaggoner[at]gmail.com.
