# Projects

Here is where I put some projects I've made in my spare time for learning or
better understanding specific skills and technologies.


## [Vapors](https://hk47196.github.io/vapors/)
Vapors is a demo clone of the Steam store search page. It was built in an afternoon using React, with miragejs to mock the backend.
Note that it was created for Webkit-based browsers, not tested on Mozilla which may have some issues.

## Open Source contributions
Additionally, various open source contributions made over the years can be found
on my Github profile.
