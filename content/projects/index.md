# Projects

Here is where I put some projects I've made in my spare time for learning or
better understanding specific skills and technologies.

## [MicroRules, a tiny C# DSL](https://github.com/HK47196/MicroRules)
A small DSL for writing expressions in that compile into callable C# functions.
Includes a lexer and parser for the language.

## [Tolkien Quest Character Sheet](https://hk47196.github.io/tolkien-quest/)
Character sheet based upon the old Tolkien Quest books. Includes saving &
loading, allows the entire form to be filled out. Attempts to look as close as
possible to the character sheet page itself.

## [Vapors](https://hk47196.github.io/vapors/)
Vapors is a demo clone of the Steam store search page. It was built in an afternoon using React, with miragejs to mock the backend.
Note that it was created for Webkit-based browsers, not tested on Mozilla which may have some issues.

## [Finance](https://hk47196.github.io/finance/)
Sample finance app frontend for learning purposes. React+JS

## [phpBB 3.3.x OIDC Provider](https://github.com/HK47196/phpbb-oidc-provider)
WIP extension to make a phpBB forum function as an OIDC provider.


## Open Source contributions
Additionally, various open source contributions made over the years can be found
on my [Github profile](https://github.com/HK47196).

## StackOverflow
I have had an account on StackOverflow for nearly 13 years as of the last time I
updated my page. While I'm not very active, you can find the account
[here](https://stackoverflow.com/users/754018/roxerio).
