Now that holidays are over I've begun tinkering on LevEd, getting the basics of
the application itself setup. I've never used Godot for a regular desktop
application before and don't have much experience with its UI system so that has
been a learning process.

Not much else to add here. Time to begin work on adding the actual editor.

I've spent a bit of time thinking on other useful features to add beyond what I
listed prior. Being able to move the pivot point of an object, and being able to
translate the origin of the grid for snapping, seems like something that would
be very useful. Once you go off the grid in Trenchbroom it becomes painful,
being able to move the grid, or even have per-object grids, seems quite useful.
